## Project task

This is a solution to the [Galleria slideshow site](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/galleria-slideshow-site-tEA4pwsa6). Created in React, using a local JSON file there is the masonry layout, slideshow logic, and lightbox view.

## Project overview

This is one of the most visually appealing React apps I've created. The home page displays more than 10 paintings and a navbar with a START SLIDESHOW button. Click on that button to start the paintings' slideshow. A slideshow was made using useParams method from react-router-dom, id-s are increasing every 4 seconds. There is also a progress bar and 2 arrows for navigation through the paintings. ArtPage displays basic info about selected painting like the artist, the artist's picture, the year it was painted, etc. I also created an error page that just displays a link to go back home.
